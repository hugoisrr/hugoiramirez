## IoT Platform

As part of an IoT platform, I developed different UI's that show the current status and the data flow from three different API's through three different Websockets. The first UI shows two cards that display the data from a Workstation, the state, and the percentage values change every time a new message is received. The colors of the states are generated dynamically as well as the number of cards depending of the workstations received. The second UI displays the data flow from 12 sensors, the user can choose a different device.

## BAMF

In Mexico City, I worked for a graphic design & marketing company, called BAMF. There I received the designs, markdown documents, user requirements, website content, then I developed several websites, some of them were only landing websites, others were complex systems and blogs. Depending on the requirements and circumstances, I used different technologies, first I started using the LAMP stack, then I used Wordpress for blogs, then I started to gain an appeal to Backend using Node and Express.
