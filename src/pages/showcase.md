## IoT Platform

As part of an IoT platform, I developed different UI's that show the current status and the data flow from three different API's through three different Websockets. The first UI shows two cards that display the data from a Workstation, the state, and the percentage values change every time a new message is received. The colors of the states are generated dynamically as well as the number of cards depending on the workstations received. The second UI displays the data flow from 12 sensors, the user can choose a different device.

## BAMF

In Mexico City, I worked for a graphic design & marketing company, called [BAMF](https://www.bamf.com.mx/). There I received the designs, markdown documents, user requirements, website content, then I developed several websites, some of them were only landing websites, others were complex systems and blogs. Depending on the requirements and circumstances, I used different technologies, first I started using the LAMP stack, then I used Wordpress for blogs, then I started to gain an appeal to Backend using Node and Express.

## Good Night Ring

One of the clients from BAMF is [Good Night Ring](https://goodnightsinronquidos.com.mx/index.html), I developed their landing web site. The design and the content were created by other teammates. One of the requirements from the client was that the site had to show several forms of payment of their products, in this case, I implemented with Paypal. In this site, I used several tools such as Parallax, JQuery functions for animations and Bootstrap.

## Drinks Finder

To evolve professionally, I prefer to follow a certain process, for instance, if I need to learn a new technology or tool, I start reading the documentation, then I like to read blogs and comments to follow best practices and techniques, sometimes I watch tutorials or follow stream videos of a project. Finally, I implement a small project of my own to accentuate the knowledge. This technique might seem long but actually has worked pretty well in several projects, because I tried to dedicate one week or less to fully understand the technology or tool, then when I implementing I work faster and efficient. An example is the following small project which is hosted on GitHub Pages, the project is a [Drink Finder](https://hugoisrr.github.io/drink-finder/) that fetches data from a free API. The Project is implemented with Materialize, ReactJS, and Axios.
